# ecommerce-infra-template

A reproducible Dev/Prod infrastructure template showcasing my approach to building small, reliable, multi-service systems.

This project focuses on architecture, orchestration and DevOps practices — not on business logic.

It represents the choices I’m learning to make when designing container-based environments that must be clear, maintainable, and consistent across development and production.

**This README provides a compact overview — the documentation will go deeper into the engineering details.**

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to provide a reliable and consistent foundation for multi-service e-commerce projects by focusing on:

### Environment consistency (Dev → Prod)

Same architecture, same images, predictable behavior.
Development supports granular rebuilds; production ensures safe, persistent restarts.

### Idempotent service initialization

PostgreSQL, MinIO, and Odoo initialize only when needed, making the system stable even after repeated rebuilds or unexpected interruptions.

### Clear network and responsibility boundaries

Each component (frontend, backend, admin/Odoo, Postgres, MinIO, observability stack) lives in its own dedicated network with explicitly defined access paths.

### Modularity & extendability

The stack is intentionally simple but ready to grow:

- Odoo Community as an ERP-style back-office
- Symfony API backend
- SvelteKit storefront
- PostgreSQL (truth/mirror)
- MinIO S3 file storage

## What this project demonstrates

This repository reflects my ability to:

- design multi-service infra with containerized boundaries
- structure Dev/Prod architectures with minimal drift
- manage idempotent and restart-safe initialization flows
- configure isolated networks for controlled communication
- handle credentials and storage endpoints consistently across services
- automate workflows through Makefile-driven commands
- integrate observability where useful (and skip it where not needed)
- keep the system understandable, explicit, and maintainable

The goal is not to show a large platform, but a thoughtful, reproducible infrastructure with real DevOps constraints in mind.
